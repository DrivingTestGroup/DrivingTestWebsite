<h1> Ontario Drivers Handbook </h1>
<h2> The Driver’s Handbook can be found online on the official MTO website, a complete printed copy can be ordered from ServiceOntario ($14.95), or bought from your local Canadian Tire. Although it can be difficult to keep track of all the information in the Driver’s Handbook. Our practice tests and mini-games are a great way to help you integrate that knowledge and reinforce it without re-reading the same dull material.</h2>
