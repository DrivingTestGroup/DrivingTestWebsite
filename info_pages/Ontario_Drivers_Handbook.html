<h1>Ontario Driver's Handbook</h1>

<div> The Driver’s Handbook can be found online on the official MTO website, a complete printed copy can be ordered from 
  ServiceOntario ($14.95), or bought from your local Canadian Tire. Although it can be difficult to keep track of all the 
  information in the Driver’s Handbook. Our practice tests and mini-games are a great way to help you integrate that knowledge 
  and reinforce it without re-reading the same dull material.</div>
